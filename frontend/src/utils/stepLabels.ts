/**
 * What each pipeline step is called in the interface.
 *
 * The backend names steps after the code that runs them: `clipper` is a
 * module, `metadata` is the shape of a payload. Neither says what the user
 * gets out of it, and `metadata` is actively misleading — that step writes ten
 * titles and a social post for each one.
 *
 * Steps are named here after their output, so the row reads as a list of
 * things you end up with rather than a list of programs that ran. A step added
 * purely as a prompt file has no entry and falls back to its own name, which
 * is what keeps a new prompt usable with no code change.
