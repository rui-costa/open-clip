/**
 * A day, typed or picked from the browser's calendar.
 *
 * Held locally and committed rather than saved on every keystroke. A
 * `type="date"` input reports its value only once all three segments are
 * filled, and a year typed digit by digit fills them repeatedly on the way:
 * 2026 arrives as 0002, then 0020, then 0202. Saving each of those wrote a
 * year in antiquity and the refetch put it back in the box under the cursor,
 * which is how a field becomes impossible to correct.
 *
 * So a change is committed only when the day is one `min`/`max` allow, and
 * anything else waits for the field to be left. A day out of those bounds is
 * never committed: on leaving, the field goes back to what was stored.
 *
 * The calendar is a button of its own rather than the whole field, because a
 * picker that opens on every click is a field that cannot be typed into.
