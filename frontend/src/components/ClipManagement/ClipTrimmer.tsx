 * half a breath or runs a beat past the punchline is off by a second or two, and
 * that second is the difference between a short somebody watches and one they
 * scroll past. Re-running the highlights step to fix it would throw away every
 * other clip in the project.
 *
 * The edit is made by watching, so the picture is the whole left pane and every
 * control sits beside it: scrub to the frame the clip should open or close on
 * and mark it, in one press. Handles put a few seconds of the surrounding
 * footage either side of the window, which is what lets that same press move an
 * edge outwards as well as in; without them there is nothing before the in point
 * to scrub to. The nudge buttons remain for an adjustment smaller than a scrub
 * can aim at, and the number fields for anyone who has an exact timecode.
 *
 * Both edges are bounded: `start` cannot go below zero, `end` cannot pass the
 * end of the source — which only the media element knows, so it reports it —
 * and the two cannot close past `MIN_CLIP_DURATION`.
 *
 * Saving moves the highlight and nothing else. The cut file, if there is one,
 * still holds the window from before the edit until the clip is rendered again,
 * which is why that render is offered here rather than left to be remembered.
