 * The thumbnail as it would come out, drawn over whatever else is on screen.

 * The browser half of `Thumbnailer` on the backend, the way `CaptionOverlay` is
 * the browser half of the caption burn: one description, two renderers. It is
 * what lets a clip show its thumbnail with no picture rendered anywhere — a
 * still is a frame with text on it, and both of those can be drawn here.
 *
 * It carries its own frame rather than borrowing the player's, because the two
 * are not frames of the same thing. A thumbnail is cut from the **source**:
 * `extract_frame` seeks the original video and applies the clipper's crop, so
 * nothing that was burned into the clip file — captions, the overlay title —
 * is in it. Drawn over a rendered clip instead, the still would show burned
 * subtitles this thumbnail explicitly switched off, and show the title twice.
 *
 * Everything is drawn at `frame_time` and held. A still has no timeline: no
 * fades, and no waiting for a word's turn.
