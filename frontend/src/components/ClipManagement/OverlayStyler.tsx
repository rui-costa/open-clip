 * here would be one line over the whole project at once.
 *
 * It is what every clip is drawn in: the thumbnails, whose words the model
 * writes, immediately; a clip's own title from the moment it is written. So a
 * project's stills look like one project without anybody typing a title on any
 * of them.
 *
 * Every change is written to the project rather than held in the page: the
 * clipper reads the same stored settings when it burns the title in, so what is
 * on screen is a promise about the render. Writes are debounced because a
 * slider drag would otherwise be a hundred of them.
