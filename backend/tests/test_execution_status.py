"""The endpoint the project page polls while a pipeline runs.

It is hit every couple of seconds by every open page, and it is the only thing
that reports a running step, so a handler that raises here is silent in the log
— the request line is written before the exception — and shows up only as a
traceback on the server's terminal and an empty reply in the browser. That is
what this covers: the response has to actually come back.
