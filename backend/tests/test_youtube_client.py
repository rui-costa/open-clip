"""Cover for opening the YouTube handle when the stored token no longer works.

A token file on disk is not an authorisation: Google can revoke the refresh
token behind it, and an OAuth client still in Testing expires one after seven
days. The file reads back the same either way, so the only place that learns
about it is the refresh, and what it raises there is what the user is shown.
