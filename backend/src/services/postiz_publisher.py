"""Imports finished clips into Postiz as posts that are ready to send.

The uploader publishes to YouTube: one channel, irreversibly, from this app.
This does the other half of the job — every other platform — by handing the
clip to the scheduler the user already runs. A clip imported here arrives in
Postiz as a draft against each connected channel, with the video attached and
the text already written, so the remaining work is reading it and pressing
send.

Drafts rather than immediate posts by default, and that default matters: an
import is meant to be safe to run over a whole project. `postiz_post_type` in
settings can make it `schedule` (at a time this computes) or `now` for a user
who wants the pipeline to end at published, but nothing here reaches an
audience unless that was asked for explicitly.

What each channel says comes from the highlight. The model already writes a
post per platform — X, LinkedIn, Reddit — so a channel gets its own text where
there is one, and the clip's YouTube description, rendered through the user's
template, where there is not.

        Nothing tells this application when a draft it filed is sent, so without

        "waiting in Postiz" forever. One request covers the whole project:
        Postiz answers with every post in a window, and the clips are matched
        against it by the post ids they carry.

        Matching is by id, and only by id. `group` looked like the thing that
        ties a clip's channels together — it is not. Postiz gives every channel
        its own group: one clip filed to two accounts came back as two posts, at
        the same minute, with two different groups. Matching on it found one
        channel and reported the other as still waiting when it had been
        published an hour earlier.

        For a clip filed before every channel's id was kept, the ids alone are
        not enough either, so a post is also claimed when it is on a channel
        this clip was filed to and shares its exact publish time with a post
        already matched. Postiz stamps the channels of one import with the same
        minute, and two imports never share one.

        What can be learned is exact — `PUBLISHED` and the platform's own URL,
        `QUEUE` for something still due, `ERROR` for a send that failed.

        A post missing from that answer is not necessarily gone, because drafts
        are never in it, so each one is asked about directly. That question has
        three outcomes and they are kept apart: the post is really there and is
        a draft, in which case the clip goes on saying it is waiting; the post
        is not there, in which case the clip stops claiming it — an id that
        resolves to nothing is worse than no id, because it reads as filed and
        the only thing that would actually file it is a re-import; or Postiz
