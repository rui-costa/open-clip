"""What the highlights prompt is asked for: how many segments, and how long.

Three layers, the same way the upload and Postiz schedules resolve: what the
project decided, then what the application decides, then what the app ships
with. A project that never chose keeps following Settings, so changing the
default there moves every project that has no opinion of its own.

The resolved numbers reach the prompt as `{min_clips}`, `{max_clips}`,
`{min_duration}`, `{max_duration}` and `{highlight_guidance}` — see
`backend/src/services/llm_query.py`.
