"""What a running step is doing, in one sentence at a time.

A step reports "running" from the moment it is triggered until it ends, which
for the LLM steps can be several minutes of one HTTP request. Nothing about
that is visible: an overloaded model being retried for the fourth time and a
request that will never return look identical from the outside, and both look
like the application has hung.

This is the channel that carries the difference. Code deep inside a step calls
`report`; the orchestrator, which is the only thing that knows which step is
running, collects what comes out and hands it to `/execution_status`.

Deliberately a thread-local rather than a parameter threaded through every
call: the reporters are leaves — a retry inside an SDK wrapper — and the
collector is the thread that started the step. Passing a sink from one to the
other would mean a progress argument on every function between them, most of
which have nothing to do with progress. A report from a thread the step
spawned itself is dropped rather than misfiled, because nothing here can know
which step that thread belongs to.

Nothing is ever raised at the caller: a step must not fail because its
narration did.
