"""Turn the client secrets a user pastes into Settings into a stored YouTube token.

Every installation needs its own OAuth consent: Google issues the refresh token
to *this* user for *this* OAuth client, so there is nothing that can be shipped
with the project. The user supplies the client secrets for their own Google
Cloud project, consents once in a browser, and the refresh token that comes back
is what `YoutubeClient` uses from then on.

The loopback redirect is used rather than the copy-a-code flow, because Google
shut the out-of-band flow down in 2022. That means the machine running this
backend must be reachable at the redirect port from the browser doing the
consenting, which is the case for a local run and for Docker once the port is
published.

A consent is therefore a small web server, and starting one must never depend on
what an earlier one is doing: pressing the button is what a user does when the
last attempt went nowhere, and being told to deal with that attempt first is
being told to care about the app's bookkeeping. Google accepts any loopback port
for a desktop client, so an attempt that cannot have the usual port simply takes
another and opens its own window. Several can be open at once; the first to come
back wins, the rest expire.

The usual port is still tried first, because it is the one a Docker run
publishes: inside a container an attempt on some other port is not reachable
from the browser at all.
